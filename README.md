# BMI-Calculator01
The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a simple and interactive web application designed to help users quickly determine their BMI based on their weight and height inputs. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides a user-friendly interface where users can enter their details and instantly receive their BMI value along with a health category (Underweight, Normal weight, Overweight, or Obese).

The layout is designed with responsive CSS for a clean and attractive look across different devices. JavaScript handles the logic of the BMI calculation and dynamically updates the result on the webpage, enhancing user interaction without requiring page reloads.
